Model Activity API For Programmers
Welcome to the Model Activity API. This API allows you to retrieve statistics for models across three different sites. Access is granted based on whether a model has a trophy/calendar icon in their bio, which indicates they are registered in our trophy database. You must successfully look up the model in our studio search one time for the model to enter the trophy database. Model must maintain the trophy/calendar on their bio to stay in the database.

Authentication
This API does not use traditional API keys. Authentication is handled by checking if the requested username exists in the trophy database for the specified domain.

If the user is not found in the database, the API will return the following error:

{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error Code:300 To use this api please add a trophy/calendar to the models bio and then use the STUDIO search successfully one time."
}
Rate Limiting
To ensure a stable service for all users, you are limited to one API request per second. Exceeding this limit may result in a temporary block.

Endpoints
The base URL for all API calls is the location of your api.php file.
